  Hi,on this week i learn intoduction to competition,how to win kaggle competition and which element can led me to win  competition.
  Competition having the following essential element to consider which are data,model,submission,evaluation </br> and leaderboard

   Also in kaggle competion tutorial i learn about explanatory data analysis which can help me to understand data and to generate 
  hypothesis.Win kaggle tutorial it cover a lot of things that was already taught by sir!SAMBAIGA include deep explanation about 
  different model and how to implement them.<br>     
    On this week,we work on project as team and we try to build the strong model and set conducive interface that can help </br> bank 
  on provision of loan to customers in order to avoid risk.On this we achieve 50% (percent) of our project work and </br>also on this 
  we try to use sampling concept to our problem in order to increase number of minority to attain equilibrium </br>level of majority.</br>       
     On this week also we discuss strategies for structuring machine learning project in this we discuss different 
   concept that</br>help to improve performance in our model,also we learn about evaluation metric and data,and what is the effect of </br>single metric in performance. </br>             
     Also we learn how to quantify human level performance work on bias and variance gap,bias is the gap between human </br> and training 
   performance while variance is the gap between training  and dev performance. </br>    
       Generally:On this week i learn a lot of things and i solve different problems practically,this week is awesome to me. 	
  </br>Special thanks to sir!Sambaiga who use a lot of time to spread knowledge and i real appeciate you help.
