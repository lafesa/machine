  On this week i learn how to predict user's interest and to simplify search of common recommended item's that user's are likely interest with, we can achieve this by using recommender system and also on this week i understand imbalance concept.
                        
 #                              Introduction 
  Recommender can help companies to gain competitive advantage to the competitors. In recommender system i understand the following concept:
  
           1.  Why recommender system were used in different companies?
           2. Advantage of implementing recommender system.
           3. Which type i can use to implementing recommender system and why i use it?
           4. Things to consider before i building a recommender system.
           5. Challenge that facing  recommender system.
           6. how evaluation of recommender system.
  
 #                             Types of recommender system
							  
On this i learn two types of recommender system that used in implementation which are:
          
           1.Characteristic information
           2.User-item interactions 

 #                            Characteristic information
This deals with information about user's and item's.
Example: Content-based system which make recommendation using user's profile and item features.
In this we assume that the user's interest of the past can be future.

 #                           User-item interactions
 This deals with information such as sales, which product needed more by user.
 Example:Collaborative filters in this we assume that interest of one user's also can be interest of other's.
 To minimize the challenge of recommender types we can use hybrid system which combine all type of recommender.
collaborative filters achieve this goals by using two method:

               1.Memory-based
               2.Model-based
                
  #                        Evaluation of recommender system
  Evaluation can  be done by following method which are: 
  
                1.Online
                2. Offline

Also on this week i learn how to use imbalanced concept to decrease or increase majority and minority in the different techniques which are:

                 1.Re-sampling techniques                     
                 2.Cost-sensitive techniques

 #                      Re-sampling
re-sampling consist of the following techniques:

                   1.Over-sampling
This can increase number of minority to attain majority equilibrium.
Example:SMOTE                

                    2.Under-sampling
This can reduce the number of majority to attain minority equilibrium.
Example: NearMiss.

#                       Challenge week one review
On this week we review week one challenge and we implement sampling concept for imbalance(over-sampling) and also we learn how to arrange you work in good manner.
Also on this we learn about confusion matrix how it can help you to choice the best model for you challange and also we were saw the different between uses of sampling and without sampling on model.

Generally the implementation of imbalance to dataset it can help to reduce the fairness decision  based on large number of certain class and also recommendation it help companies to increase the productive of item's.
